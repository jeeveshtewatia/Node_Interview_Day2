        <button class="accordion"> Question- 1.What are the different types of HTTP requests??
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be
            performed on a particular resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH,
            and DELETE. These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). <br>
            <strong> GET:</strong> GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP
            status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server. <br>
            <strong> POST: </strong>POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to
            the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201. <br> <strong> PUT:</strong> A PUT
            request is used to
            modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is
            passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one. <br>
            <strong> PATCH:</strong>
            PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only
            replace the content that you want to update. <br> <strong> DELETE: </strong> A DELETE request is used to
            delete the data on the
            server at a specified location.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 2.Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.
        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            Express.js is a routing and Middleware framework for handling the different routing of the
            webpage and it
            works between the request and response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request
            and before the controller actions send the response. Middleware has the access to the request object,
            responses object, and next, it can process the request before the server send a response. An Express-based
            application is a series of middleware function calls. Middleware Chaining: Middleware can be chained from
            one to another, Hence creating a chain of functions that are executed in order. The last function sends the
            response back to the browser. So, before sending the response back to the browser the different middleware
            processes the request. The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware
            function if there is one.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 3.Explain CORS.</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <strong> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing </strong> is a mechanism by which data or any other resource of a
            site could be shared
            intentionally to a third party website when there is a need. Generally, access to resources that are
            residing in a third party site is restricted by the browser clients for security purposes.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 4.What is Express? How does it help you to create a backend
            application.</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <strong> Express.js:</strong> Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server
            functionality to simplify
            its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with
            middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects. It facilitates the rendering of
            dynamic HTTP objects. *More features than Node.js *It is used to build web-apps using approaches and
            principles of Node.js. *Routing is provided. *It requires less coding time. *Uses middleware for the
            arrangement of functions systematically server-side.

        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that
            request can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP
            header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 6. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS.
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to
            encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that
            uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://. Some difference of http and
            https;

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 7.What are JWT tokens?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <strong> JSON web token (JWT)</strong>, pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
            compact and
            self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Again, JWT is a
            standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs. when we logged-in somewhere , they
            provide us a unique token.which helps us to access through it token is provided only when the registered
            data and login data are matching. Ex:-facebook
